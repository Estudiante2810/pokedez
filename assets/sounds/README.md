# Pokemon Sounds

This folder contains audio files for Pokemon sounds.

You can add Pokemon cry sound files here (.mp3, .ogg, etc.).

The app currently uses online Pokemon cries from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/cries/main/cries/pokemon/latest/[ID].ogg

To use local sounds instead, place your sound files here and update the SoundService.
